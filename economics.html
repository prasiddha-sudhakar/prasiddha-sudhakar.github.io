  <p>Here are all of the notes that I took whilst studying HL Economics in IBDP. Please note that there are different modules that need to be covered in the HL and SL syllabus.
    Happy studying and hope I was able to break down some tough concepts for you to understand! :)</p>

      <p>Here, we will begin by exploring the circular flow of income model. In order to do that, we will start with a few basic definitions.</p>

      <p>There are 4 few factors of production:</p>

        <p>In the Neoclassical Model, an deflationary gap will correct itself. Here are the reasons why:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>As shown in figure 1.2, the economy is currently in a recession (and currently has high levels of unemployment as Y is less than Yf) </li>
          <li>However, in the long run, as Y is less than Yf, the economy is not producing as much real output as it potentially could. FOr this reason, firms will demand less factors of production as it is not ncessary.</li>
          <li>This leads to a fall in the prices of factors of production, which in fact, causes SRAS to shift to the right</li>
          <li>As a result, the economy returns to equiibrium and closes the deflationary gap by itself</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Keynsian</h5>
        <p>In the Keynsian model, a deflationary gap won't close itself. This is because: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>FOPs and wage rates aren't flexible. They are totally fixed</li>
          <li>Low profits and losses because of high costs</li>
          <li>As a result, the economy is stuck in a deflationary gap</li>

      <h4>Expansionary Fiscal Policy</h4>
      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>Expansionary Fiscal Policy: </b> Government policies that aim to shift AD right through the use of higher government expenditure and lower taxation to achieve economic growth
      </div>

      <p>These policies can be used to close deflationary gaps in the Keynsian model</p>

      <p>
        <b>INSERT DIAGRAM HERE</b>
      </p>

      <p>But to what extent does expensionary fiscal policy promote <b>economic growth</b>?</p>
      <p>After examining both keynsian and neoclassical models, we will find that using expansionary fiscal policy to achieve economic growth is purely inflationary in the long run.</p>

      <h5>Neoclassical</h5>
      <p>As an example, let's say that we are currently at Yf and the government decides to cut income taxes to stimulate growth</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In Figure x, the economy is initially at Yf, producing at average price level P</li>
        <li>AD shifts right due to the increase of disposible income</li>
        <li>After AD shifting, this shows an economy with an inflationary gap in the short run</li>
        <li>Now, SRAS shifts left as the price of FOPs become more expensive as firms compete for scarce FOPs</li>
        <li>As a result, the economy is back to Yf, but producing at a higher price level P1</li>
        <li>Thus, it is purely inflationary</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Keynsian</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>In Figure x, the economy is initially at Yf, producing at average price level P</li>
        <li>AD shifts right due to the increase of disposible income</li>
        <li>However, it is evident that there is no economic growth</li>
        <li>And, it is purely inflationary</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Contractionary Fiscal Policy</h4>
      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>Contractionary Fiscal Policy: </b> Government policies that aim to shift AD left through the use of lower government expenditure and higher taxation to control inflation
      </div>

      <p>These can be used to close inflationary gaps by increasing taxation and lowering government spending, directly targetting investment and consumption as components of AD</p>

      <h4>The Keynsian Multiplier</h4>
      <p>The fundamental argument behind the multiplier is to encourage the use of government spending during a recession.</p>
      <p>Let's say that there's an increase in one of the components of AD, causing it to shift to the right. We can see that the final increase in real output/GDP will most likely be greater than the initial increase in expenditures.</p>

      <p class="math">
        \[multiplier = {\text{change in real GDP} \over \text{initial change in expenditure}}\]
      </p>

      <p>So... how do we calculate the multiplier?</p>

      <p>First, there are a few important terms that we must define a few key terms</p>

      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>Marginal Propensity to Consume [MPC]: </b> Is the extra amount of consumption which occurs as a result of a given increase in income
      </div>

      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>Marginal Propensity to Save [MPS]: </b> Is the extra amount of saving which occurs as a result of a given increase in income
      </div>

      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>Marginal Propensity to Import [MPM]: </b> Is the extra amount of imports which occurs as a result of a given increase in income
      </div>

      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>Marginal Rate of Taxation [MRT]: </b> Is the extra amount of tax which occurs as a result of a given increase in income
      </div>

      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>Marginal Propensity to Withdraw [MPW]: </b> MPS + MPM + MRT
      </div>

      <p>Let's denote the multiplier as <i>k</i></p>

      <p class="math">
        \[k = {1 \over \ (1 - MPC)} = {1 \over \ (MPW)} = {1 \over \ (MPS + MPM + MRT)}\]
      </p>

      <p>What's the significance of using the multiplier?</p>
      <p>It's a good indicator to the government on how much government spending is necessary to return the economy to Yf</p>
      <p>For example, in a recession, <b>MPC</b> is low as consumer confidence is low. This means that governments much spend more to get the economy back into shape</p>

          <h5 class="mt-0">Progressive Income Tax</h5>
          <p>In the peak of the business cycle, incomes rise as the economy is booming. As incomes rise, the government is able to have higher sources of revenue due to progressive income tax.
            This means that consumers have lower disposible incomes, causing consumption to fall. This controls the economy when it's booming. </p>
          <p> On the other hand, during the truph of the business cycle, incomes fall. Henceforth, the government will have lower tax revenues and consumers will have higher disposible incomes.
            This causes consumption to increase and stimulates the economy during a recession.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-0">Unemployment Benefits</h5>
          <p>In an economic boom, unemployment benefits are reduced as less people are unemployed. As a result, consumption increases less than if unemployment benefits existed. This causes consumption to drop and ease the economy in a boom</p>
          <p>The opposite case is when there's a recession. If there is more unemployment, the government will give out more unemployment benefits. With this in mind, consumption will slightly increase and improve the economy.</p>

      <h5>The basic idea of crowding out: As the government spends more money, it reduces the amount of resources available for private firms</h5>
      <p>A fundamental assumption about the government is that the government <i>needs</i> to borrow money and that there is a <i>budget deficit</i>. We assume that the government needs to borrow money due to a deflationary gap; there will be a fall
        in incomes and so the government will have lower revenues from taxes</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The initial equiibrium is where DLF = SLF and Q quantity of loanable funds is lent and borrowed at interest rate r</li>
        <li>Due to the government increasing the demand for the loanable funds, they inadvertently drive up the interest rate as loanable funds become more scarce</li>
        <li>This shows how as the government spends more money, this reduces the amoutn of resources available for private firms - aka; "crowds them out"</li>

      <h5>Monetary Policy is a type of <span class="badge badge-info">Demand Side Policy</span></h5>

      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>Monetary Policy: </b> Government policies aiming to manipulate the supply of money and interest rate in order to change the level of AD
      </div>

      <p>First of all - what is the <b>central bank?</b></p>

      <p>A central bank is a government financial institution that has several key responsibilities:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Banker to the government</li>
        <li>Banked to commercial banks</li>
        <li>Regulator of commercial banks</li>
        <li>Conduct monetary policy</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Determination of interest rate</h2>

      <p>You can think about this in terms of demand and supply with quantity of money on the x axis and interest rate on the y axis </p>

      <p>What would happen if we decided to increase the supply of money?</p>

      <p>Firstly, we would need to look at how the demand and supply curves would look like for money based on <i>elasticities</i></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Demand:</b> This is the same old downward sloping demand curve
          <ul>
            <li>As the interest rate falls, the demand for money (for loans) increases</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Supply:</b> This would be <i>perfectly inelastic</i> (straight line)
          <ul>
            <li>The supply of money is not affected by the interest rate</li>
            <li>This is a fixed rate determined by the central bank</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In IB Economics, we do not focus on the central bank manipulating the supply of money. Instead, we focus on the manipulation of the interest rate</p>

      <h2>The role of monetary policy</h2>

      <p>Monetary policy aims to target the levels of investment and consumption in the economy and manipulate AD</p>

      <h3>Expansionary monetary policy</h3>

      <p>When <b>cutting</b> interest rates, individuals and firms have accumulated <b>less</b> interest therefore they are <b>more</b> incentivized to take out loans</p>
      <p>This would shift AD to the <b>right</b></p>

      <h3>Contractionary monetary policy</h3>

      <p>When <b>increasing</b> interest rates, individuals and firms have accumulated <b>more</b> interest therefore they are <b>less</b> incentivized to take out loans</p>
      <p>This would shift AD to the <b>left</b></p>

      <h3>Targetting inflation using monetary policy</h3>

      <p>Inflation targetting, according to the IMF, is defined as:</p>

      <p> <i>‘... the public announcement of medium-term
          numerical targets for infl ation with an institutional
          commitment by the monetary authority to achieve
          these targets. Additional key features include increased
          communication with the public and the markets about
          the plans and objectives of monetary policymakers
          and increased accountability of the central bank for
          attaining its infl ation objectives.’</i></p>

      <p>Advantages of targetting inflation:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Lower rates are achievable</li>
        <li>Stability in low rates of inflation
          <ul>
            <li>Due to this, economic decision making becomes significantly easier</li>
            <li>This makes it easier to anticipate future inflation</li>
